## Implementation Roadmap

The PipelineVision project follows our proven progressive MVP methodology with a strategic timeline designed to validate core assumptions, reduce technical risk, and deliver value incrementally. Each MVP phase builds on validated learnings from the previous phase.

## MVP Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Start Small, Move Fast**: Validate critical assumptions quickly with minimal investment
- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Rapid iteration based on real-world feedback and data
- **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decision making at each stage with clear success criteria
- **User-Centric Evolution**: VanGuard user needs drive feature prioritization and design
- **Partnership Approach**: Transparent collaboration with continuous stakeholder engagement

## Planning Philosophy

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
Every planning decision is grounded in:
- Peer-reviewed academic research
- Industry best practices
- Historical project data
- Stakeholder feedback

### Risk-Aware Planning
Systematic identification and mitigation of:
- Technical implementation risks
- Business adoption risks
- Operational execution risks
- Market and competitive risks

### Agile Execution
Flexible, iterative approach featuring:
- Phased MVP development
- Continuous stakeholder feedback
- Regular plan refinement
- Rapid course correction

### Three-Phase MVP Strategy
