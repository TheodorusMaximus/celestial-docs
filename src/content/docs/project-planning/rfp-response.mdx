## Executive Summary

We propose to deliver a proof-of-concept aerial pipeline inspection system that integrates high-resolution imagery from VanGuard's Sony ILX-LR1 industrial camera with real-time AI inference (YOLOv8) and geospatial tagging. Through our proven three-phase MVP approach, we will deliver a bench-ready solution, progress to edge processing, and culminate in a fully integrated flight-ready system.

### Mission Alignment

**PipelineVision accelerates VanGuard's pipeline safety leadership** by integrating advanced computer vision into your proven Falcon pod system. Our data-driven MVP roadmap validates core AI concepts, then iterates through live edge demos to in-flight deployments—balancing speed, cost, and risk while maintaining your competitive advantage.
