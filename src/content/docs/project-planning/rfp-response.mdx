## Executive Summary

The core objective of this engagement is to deliver a proof-of-concept aerial pipeline inspection system that integrates high-resolution imagery from VanGuard's Sony ILX-LR1 industrial camera (or appropriate hardware) with real-time AI inference (YOLOv8) and geospatial tagging. This will be achieved through a three-phase MVP approach. We will deliver a bench-ready solution, progress to edge processing, and culminate in a fully integrated flight-ready system.

### Mission Alignment

**PipelineVision accelerates VanGuard's pipeline safety leadership** by integrating advanced computer vision into your proven Falcon pod system. The planned data-driven MVP roadmap validates core AI concepts, then iterates through live edge demos, and lastly in-flight deployments intending to balance speed, cost, and risk.
