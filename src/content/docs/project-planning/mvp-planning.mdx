# MVP Development Strategy

## Overview

The PipelineVision project follows a progressive MVP strategy designed to validate core assumptions, reduce technical risk, and deliver value incrementally. Each MVP phase builds on validated learnings from the previous phase.

## MVP Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Start Small, Move Fast**: Validate critical assumptions quickly
- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Rapid iteration based on real-world feedback
- **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decision making at each stage
- **User-Centric Evolution**: Operator needs drive feature prioritization

## Three-Phase MVP Approach

```
MVP-0: Ground Proof    →    MVP-1: Live Edge    →    MVP-2: In-Flight
(Cloud Validation)         (Local Processing)        (Operational System)
   Months 1-2                  Month 3                 Months 4-7
     $50K                      $104K                     $345K
```
