## Implementation Roadmap

The PipelineVision project follows our proven progressive MVP methodology with a strategic timeline designed to validate core assumptions, reduce technical risk, and deliver value incrementally. Each MVP phase builds on validated learnings from the previous phase.

## MVP Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Start Small, Move Fast**: Validate critical assumptions quickly with minimal investment
- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Rapid iteration based on real-world feedback and data
- **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decision making at each stage with clear success criteria
- **User-Centric Evolution**: VanGuard operator needs drive feature prioritization and design
- **Partnership Approach**: Transparent collaboration with continuous stakeholder engagement

### Three-Phase MVP Strategy

```
MVP-0: Cloud Proof of Concept  →  MVP-1: Edge Demonstration  →  MVP-2: Production Integration
