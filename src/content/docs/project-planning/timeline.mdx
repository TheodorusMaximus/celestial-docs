## Critical Path Analysis

### Dependencies and Bottlenecks

**Critical Path Items:**
1. **Dataset Acquisition** (Month 4) - Blocks model training
2. **Hardware Procurement** (Month 5) - Blocks pod integration
3. **FAA Approvals** (Month 7) - Blocks flight testing
4. **Operator Buy-in** (Month 8) - Blocks deployment

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Parallel workstreams where possible
- Early procurement initiation
- Regulatory engagement from Month 1
- Continuous stakeholder communication

## Schedule Contingencies

### Buffer Allocation
- **Technical Contingency**: 15% time buffer on development tasks
- **Integration Buffer**: 20% on hardware integration
- **Testing Buffer**: 25% on flight testing activities
- **Overall Project Buffer**: 2 months (can extend to Month 13)

### Acceleration Opportunities
- **Parallel Development**: MVP-1 and MVP-2 prep overlap
- **Early Dataset Collection**: Start Month 2 vs Month 4
- **Pre-procurement**: Order Jetson hardware Month 1
- **Agile Sprints**: 2-week cycles for faster iteration
