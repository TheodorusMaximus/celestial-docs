# Risk Management Framework

## Risk Assessment Overview

The PipelineVision project employs a hypothesis-driven development approach with systematic risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies across technical, business, and operational dimensions.

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks
Risks related to technology implementation, performance, and integration

### Business Risks
Market, competitive, and adoption-related risks

### Operational Risks
Execution, resource, and timeline risks

### Data Risks
Dataset acquisition, quality, and model training risks

## Critical Risk Register

### HIGH PRIORITY RISKS

#### Risk #1: Dataset Acquisition Failure
**Category**: Data/Technical  
**Probability**: Medium (40%)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Score**: 8/10

**Description**: Unable to acquire sufficient aerial excavator imagery for model training

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Proxy Detection Strategy**: Use truck class as excavator proxy (validated at ≥70% correlation)
2. **Multi-Tier Data Approach**: Combine DOTA + AIDCON + custom collection
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use domain adaptation and augmentation
4. **Fallback Option**: Partner with annotation services for rapid dataset creation

**Monitoring Indicators**:
- Proxy validation metrics by Month 2
- Dataset size tracking weekly
- Model performance on test sets

#### Risk #2: Edge Computing Performance
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Low (25%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 6/10

**Description**: Jetson AGX Orin cannot achieve over 10 FPS inference requirement

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Model Optimization**: TensorRT quantization and pruning
2. **Resolution Scaling**: Dynamic resolution based on scene complexity
3. **Hardware Upgrade Path**: Jetson AGX Orin Industrial (higher spec)
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Critical region prioritization

**Monitoring Indicators**:

#### Risk #3: Operator Resistance
**Category**: Business  
**Probability**: Medium (35%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Score**: 7/10

**Description**: Pilots reject or distrust AI-generated alerts

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Trust Calibration**: Target 85% AIR to build confidence
2. **Operator-Centric Design**: Based on "Alex Rivera" persona insights
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with advisory mode, not mandatory
4. **Champion Program**: Identify and empower early adopters

**Monitoring Indicators**:
- Operator feedback scores
- Alert acknowledgment rates
- System usage statistics
