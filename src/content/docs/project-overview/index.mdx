# PipelineVision: Transforming Pipeline Safety

## Executive Summary

PipelineVision is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to enhance VanGuard Pipeline's existing Falcon pod platform with real-time threat detection capabilities. This project automates the identification of construction threats like excavators along pipeline corridorsâ€”moving beyond gas detection to create a more comprehensive safety net.

## The Opportunity

VanGuard Pipeline Inspection has built an exceptional business providing real-time, in-cockpit methane detection. However, detection of physical threats to pipeline right-of-way still relies entirely on manual visual scanning, creating critical challenges:

### Human Factors Risk
Continuous visual scanning over 4-6 hour flights causes cognitive fatigue and missed threats

### Safety Exposure
Undetected excavator strikes cost the industry $30-60 billion annually with 136+ casualties over 10 years

### Competitive Vulnerability
While VanGuard leads in methane detection, competitors are advancing in automated threat detection

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Automated Threat Detection**: Achieve over 90% recall for excavators and exposed pipes
- **Real-Time Processing**: Deliver over 10 FPS inference on edge hardware during flight
- **Operator Trust**: Maintain over 85% Actionable Intelligence Rate (AIR)
- **Seamless Integration**: Zero disruption to existing VanGuard workflows

### Secondary Objectives
- Build foundation for multi-threat detection expansion
- Create data pipeline for continuous model improvement
- Enable competitive differentiation through AI capabilities

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- YOLOv8-based computer vision model for threat detection
- Edge computing on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin hardware
- Integration with existing Sony ILX-LR1 camera systems
- iPad interface for operator alerts and feedback
- GPS/KMZ corridor validation and logging
- Three-phase MVP development approach

### Out of Scope
- Modification of existing gas detection systems
- Changes to aircraft hardware or certification
- Cloud-based processing (all inference at edge)
- Automated flight path adjustments
- Integration with external reporting systems (Phase 1)

## Stakeholders

### VanGuard Pipeline Team
- **Operators**: Alex "Eagle Eye" Rivera persona - experienced pilots requiring trust in AI alerts
- **Management**: Seeking competitive advantage and operational efficiency
- **Technical Team**: Responsible for system integration and maintenance

### Development Team

- **Integration Specialist**: Hardware and VanGuard systems (30% allocation)

## Success Metrics

### Operational Performance
- **Actionable Intelligence Rate**: over 85% operator confirmation
- **Detection Performance**: over 90% recall, over 80% precision
- **Processing Speed**: over 10 FPS sustained operation
- **System Reliability**: over 99% uptime during flights

### Business Impact
- **Strike Prevention**: $7.84M annual savings (25% improvement)
- **Operational Efficiency**: $499K annual labor savings
- **Premium Revenue**: $1.2M from enhanced service offering
- **ROI**: 4,208% over 3 years

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
- **Input**: Sony ILX-LR1 high-resolution video feed
- **Processing**: Real-time frame capture and normalization
- **Detection**: YOLOv8 model optimized for aerial imagery
- **Output**: Bounding boxes with threat classifications

### Compute Infrastructure
- **MVP-0**: Cloud resources for proof-of-concept

- GPS/KMZ corridor data
- Operational logging systems

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Edge processing limitations (power, compute, storage)
- Real-time performance requirements (under 100ms latency)
- Aircraft vibration and environmental conditions
- Limited connectivity during flight operations

### Business Constraints
- $683K total budget with milestone-based payments
- 11-month deployment timeline
- No disruption to current operations
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Data Constraints
- Limited aerial excavator imagery availability
- Domain transfer from ground to aerial perspective
- Annotation quality and consistency requirements
