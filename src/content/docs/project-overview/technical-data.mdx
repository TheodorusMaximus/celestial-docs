- **Volume**: 11,268 professionally annotated aerial images
- **Coverage**: 15 object categories including vehicles, aircraft, ships
- **Value**: Provides aerial perspective baseline and geometric understanding
- **Performance**: 93.8% mAP@0.5 on aerial vehicle detection benchmarks

#### Tier 2: Domain Transfer (AIDCON)
- **Source**: AIDCON Construction Equipment Dataset
- **Volume**: 9,563 construction equipment objects across 3,000+ images
- **Coverage**: Excavators, bulldozers, cranes, trucks from ground perspective
- **Value**: Construction equipment domain knowledge for transfer learning
- **Strategy**: Bridge gap between aerial and ground-based equipment detection

#### Tier 3: Pipeline-Specific Collection (To be determined)

## Risk Management & Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risk Framework

Our risk management approach aligns with the phased MVP methodology, providing clear pivot points and fallback strategies at each development stage.

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Data Domain Gap** | High (60%) | Medium | Multi-dataset training + synthetic augmentation |
| **Edge Performance** | Medium (30%) | High | Model compression + hybrid processing fallback |
| **Integration Complexity** | Medium (35%) | Medium | Phased integration + standalone tablet fallback |
| **Operator Adoption** | Low (20%) | High | Extensive user testing + training programs |

#### Risk #1: Data Domain Gap (MVP-0 Phase)
**Challenge**: Public aerial datasets may not represent VanGuard's specific operational environment  
**Indicators**: &lt;70% proxy detection correlation in validation testing  
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement synthetic data augmentation pipeline
- Expedite custom VanGuard data collection
- Develop robust domain adaptation techniques
- Maintain multiple model architectures for comparison

#### Risk #2: Edge Compute Performance (MVP-1 Phase)
**Challenge**: Jetson AGX Orin may not achieve target latency per frame  
**Indicators**: Sustained performance below 15 FPS or excessive power consumption  
**Mitigation**:
- Apply model quantization and pruning techniques
- Upgrade to higher-performance edge hardware if necessary
- Optimize TensorRT inference pipeline

#### Risk #3: Integration Complexity (MVP-2 Phase)
**Challenge**: Unexpected API or hardware compatibility issues with Falcon pod systems  
**Indicators**: Communication failures or workflow disruption during testing  
**Mitigation**:
- Develop standalone tablet interface as fallback
- Implement incremental integration with extensive testing
- Maintain extended integration timeline buffer
- Create comprehensive rollback procedures

### System Reliability & Fault Tolerance

#### Redundancy Architecture
- **Dual-Model Strategy**: Primary YOLOv8 model with lightweight backup for fallback
- **Hardware Redundancy**: Automatic failover to CPU-only processing if GPU fails
- **Communication Redundancy**: Multiple iPad interface protocols (WebSocket → REST → Local)
- **Data Redundancy**: Local storage with multiple backup copies and integrity checking

#### Error Handling & Recovery
