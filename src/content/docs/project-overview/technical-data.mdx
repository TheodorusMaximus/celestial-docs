## Data Architecture & Training Strategy

### Multi-Tier Data Foundation

Our data strategy addresses the critical challenge of pipeline-specific threat detection through a progressive, three-tier approach that maximizes model performance while minimizing custom data requirements.

#### Tier 1: Foundation Dataset (DOTA + VisDrone)
- **Source**: DOTA (Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images)
- **Volume**: 11,268 professionally annotated aerial images
- **Coverage**: 15 object categories including vehicles, aircraft, ships
- **Value**: Provides aerial perspective baseline and geometric understanding
- **Performance**: 93.8% mAP@0.5 on aerial vehicle detection benchmarks

#### Tier 2: Domain Transfer (AIDCON)
- **Source**: AIDCON Construction Equipment Dataset
- **Volume**: 9,563 construction equipment objects across 3,000+ images
- **Coverage**: Excavators, bulldozers, cranes, trucks from ground perspective
- **Value**: Construction equipment domain knowledge for transfer learning
- **Strategy**: Bridge gap between aerial and ground-based equipment detection

#### Tier 3: Pipeline-Specific Collection (To be determined)
- **Source**: VanGuard operational flights and targeted collection
- **Volume**: 500-1,000+ professionally annotated pipeline corridor images
- **Coverage**: Seasonal variations, lighting conditions, threat scenarios
- **Value**: Domain-specific optimization for VanGuard's operational environment

### Proxy Detection Strategy

**Challenge**: Limited pipeline-specific training data for excavator detection  
**Solution**: Use alternative class as excavator proxy with 70%+ correlation threshold  
**Validation**: Progressive refinement with custom VanGuard data collection  
**Risk Mitigation**: Parallel development of custom classes to reduce proxy dependence
