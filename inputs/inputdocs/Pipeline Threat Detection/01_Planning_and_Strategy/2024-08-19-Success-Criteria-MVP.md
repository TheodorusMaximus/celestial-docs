# Success Criteria for the MVP

**Summary:** This document defines the proposed success criteria for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It establishes a primary, business-focused metric supported by secondary engineering KPIs.

**Body:**

To ensure the MVP delivers undeniable value and justifies further investment, we must define success in a clear, measurable, and business-relevant way. Given that the operator's role is to supervise an automated system, the MVP's value is best measured by its ability to provide reliable and actionable intelligence without increasing cognitive load.

### Recommended Primary Success Criterion: Actionable Intelligence Rate (AIR)

*   **Definition:** At least **85% of all alerts generated by the system during pilot testing are confirmed by the operator as valid and warranting attention.**
*   **Justification:** This is a holistic metric that directly measures the system's real-world value. It answers the question, "Is the system providing useful signal, or distracting noise?" An AIR of 85% or higher would confirm the system is a powerful enhancement to the operator's supervisory role.
*   **Measurement:** Requires a simple "Confirm/Dismiss" feedback mechanism within the operator UI for each alert.

### Supporting Engineering KPIs

While the AIR is the primary goal, our development will be guided by two core technical KPIs that are prerequisites for achieving a high AIR.

1.  **KPI: Critical Threat Detection Rate**
    *   **Target:** >90% Recall
    *   **Definition:** The system must correctly identify and flag at least 90% of all `excavator` and `exposed_pipe` threats in a representative, unseen test dataset.
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures the system reliably performs its core safety function of not missing critical threats.

2.  **KPI: Nuisance Alert Rate**
    *   **Target:** < 1 false alert per 3 operational hours.
    *   **Definition:** The system must generate, on average, fewer than one false positive alert for a critical threat class during every three hours of flight time.
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures the system maintains operator trust and is not perceived as an annoyance, which is critical for user adoption.

### Enhanced MVP Bridge to Operational Success

The enhanced "Sign-of-Life" MVP now creates a direct measurement pathway to the operational 85% AIR target through foundational validation metrics:

### 3. MVP-to-Operational Success Bridge

**Phase 1 (Enhanced MVP) Foundational Metrics:**
*   **Proxy Validation Foundation:** ≥70% detection rate on excavator imagery using truck detection
    - *Bridges to*: Custom model training requirements and expected performance baselines
*   **Domain Transfer Foundation:** ≥50% detection performance on aerial vs ground imagery  
    - *Bridges to*: Aerial dataset acquisition strategy and training data requirements
*   **Feedback Infrastructure Foundation:** 100% detection events captured with structured operator feedback
    - *Bridges to*: Direct AIR measurement capability in operational deployment
*   **Multi-Threat Coverage Foundation:** Successful detection of both vehicle and linear feature proxies
    - *Bridges to*: Comprehensive threat detection system scope validation

**Phase 2 (Operational MVP) Target Metrics:**
*   **Primary Target:** 85% Actionable Intelligence Rate (validated through enhanced MVP feedback infrastructure)
*   **Technical Targets:** >90% Critical Threat Detection Rate, <1 false alert per 3 hours

**Success Pathway Logic:**
1. Enhanced MVP validates proxy strategies and measurement infrastructure
2. Phase 2 fine-tunes models based on MVP findings and implements operational feedback system
3. Phase 2 achieves 85% AIR through validated technical foundation and proven feedback mechanisms

### Conclusion

The enhanced MVP transforms from a pure technical demonstration into a **strategic validation bridge** that directly enables 85% AIR measurement. Every enhanced requirement creates operational infrastructure rather than throwaway validation, ensuring seamless progression from proof-of-concept to operational success.
