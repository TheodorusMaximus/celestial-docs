# Project Framework: The Double Diamond

**Summary:** This document outlines our adoption of the Double Diamond design framework to ensure we are building the right thing, and then building it right.

**Body:**

We will use the Double Diamond as our guiding framework for problem-solving and solution development. This ensures we thoroughly explore the problem space before jumping to solutions.

### Diamond 1: Problem Space ("Build the Right Thing")

1.  **Discover (Diverge):** A broad exploration of the user, their context, and their challenges. We will collect raw insights and challenge our own assumptions.
    *   **Artifacts:** [[1_Discover/]]

2.  **Define (Converge):** Synthesizing our discoveries into a single, actionable problem statement. This will be our North Star.
    *   **Artifacts:** [[2_Define/]]

### Diamond 2: Solution Space ("Build the Thing Right")

3.  **Develop (Diverge):** Brainstorming and prototyping multiple potential solutions to the defined problem.
    *   **Artifacts:** [[3_Develop/]]

4.  **Deliver (Converge):** Selecting the best solution and refining it through testing until it is ready for deployment. The "Sign-of-Life" test is an early artifact of this phase.
    *   **Artifacts:** [[4_Deliver/]]

## Connections
*   This framework guides the entire project, as documented in the [[00_Project_Hub/2024-08-19-MOC-Pipeline-Threat-Detection-Project]].
