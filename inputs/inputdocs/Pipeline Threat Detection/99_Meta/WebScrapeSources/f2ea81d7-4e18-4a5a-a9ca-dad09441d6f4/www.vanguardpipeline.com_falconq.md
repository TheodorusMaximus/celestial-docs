# Falcon-Q

COMING MIDSUMMER 2025

Get ready to transform your leak detection game. The Falcon-Q is set to deliver precise flow rate measurements in kilograms per hour, bringing cutting-edge technology to your fingertips. Don’t miss out on this exciting rollout.

## THE FALCON XL AERIAL METHANE DETECTOR

Easy Plug-N-Play Operation

Engineered for ease of use, the Falcon XL methane detector uses laser technology to sense the amount of methane over the pipeline.  This allows operators to quickly and easily find natural gas leaks while on routine patrol, complying with leak detection requirements safely and efficiently.

### ON THE TRAJECTORY TO SAFETY

The Falcon XL's high sensitivity to methane allows it to be flown at high altitudes, up to 1,000ft above the ground, (much higher than traditional helicopter leak detection systems).  For many missions, this allows leak detection to be accomplished from Cessna aircraft, providing higher margins of safety, lower operating costs, and a quieter environmental footprint.

### LOWER EMISSIONS & OPTIMIZE EFFICIENCY

By precisely identifying methane gas leaks during pipeline patrols, our product allows for prompt and targeted repairs, preventing the release of CH₄ emissions into the environment. This proactive approach not only mitigates environmental impact but also enhances the overall operational efficiency of pipelines, minimizing resource wastage and ensuring a safer and more sustainable energy infrastructure.

Seamless User Experience

We've developed an easy-to-use iPad app for monitoring and controlling the Falcon-XL.  The app displays methane detection in real-time, safely, and autonomously, enabling decision-making based on second-by-second information.

Unlike other technology, the Falcon XL data output(s) require no complex post-flight analysis and it instantly alerts the pilot if a methane gas leak is found. Leak detection data is entirely confidential and will only be shared with those to whom the pilot and/or sensor operator delegates the responsibility.

### ENHANCED DATA SECURITY

The mobile app serves as an intuitive command center, allowing users to view live methane readings. A video feed gives operators a clear view of the entire right-of-way, providing a real-time visual reference, and enhancing situational awareness during operations. Simultaneously, live PPM readings deliver immediate feedback on methane levels, ensuring proactive monitoring and response capabilities. The app's GPS map facilitates accurate tracking and recording of the detection area, optimizing data collection efficiency.

### REAL-TIME INFORMATION

With the Vanguard information architecture, post-flight analysis is simple. Using the iPad, the pilot can share the methane readings via a KML file which opens in Google Earth. The methane parts per million are graphically displayed as a height map when opened with Google Earth, allowing users to pinpoint definite locations of suspected leaks.
