# From Sensing to Scanning

COMING MIDSUMMER 2025

Building on the trusted legacy of the Falcon-XL, the Falcon-RS represents the future of aerial methane detection technology. While the Falcon-XL transformed pipeline leak surveys, the Falcon-RS advances the game with remarkable improvements in speed, sensitivity, and reliability.

## THE FALCON-RS AERIAL METHANE DETECTOR

Features At-a-Glance

#### Enhanced Sensitivity

Detects even the smallest leaks with precision.

#### Rapid Scanning Laser

Expands coverage for superior detection in dynamic conditions.

#### Laser Altimeter

Ensures accuracy over uneven or hilly terrain.

#### Effortless Operation

Delivers instant methane readings post-flight via Google Earth or any GIS software.

At its core, the Falcon-RS features a cutting-edge, rapidly scanning laser that enhances methane detection—even in challenging weather conditions. The system continuously monitors the area below the aircraft, adeptly identifying gas leaks despite shifting winds. This enhanced scanning capability minimizes the impact of wind fluctuations, delivering consistent and dependable results mid-flight.

### ON THE TRAJECTORY TO SAFETY

Designed to keep you compliant with the latest methane leak detection regulations, the Falcon-RS seamlessly integrates accurate, real-time data into your pipeline integrity management programs. Its advanced technology accelerates leak detection with greater precision, reducing the risk of oversight—so you can respond swiftly when it counts.

### LOWER EMISSIONS & OPTIMIZE EFFICIENCY

Crafted for the rigorous demands of oil and gas operators, the Falcon-RS retains the user-friendly simplicity of the Falcon-XL. Despite its sophisticated features, it remains intuitive to operate. With a streamlined interface and an easy-to-use app, pilots can concentrate on the mission rather than wrestling with complex technology. Automatic alarm thresholds and real-time alerts empower operators to pinpoint gas leaks efficiently, with minimal training required.

Seamless User Experience

Like its predecessor, the Falcon-RS is FAA-approved for rapid installation on Cessna aircraft and helicopters. Setup takes mere minutes, requiring no aircraft modifications. It integrates effortlessly with existing pipeline patrol aircraft, making it a natural addition to routine visual patrol missions.

Unlike other technology, the Falcon XL data output(s) require no complex post-flight analysis and it instantly alerts the pilot if a methane gas leak is found. Leak detection data is entirely confidential and will only be shared with those to whom the pilot and/or sensor operator delegates the responsibility.

### ENHANCED DATA SECURITY

The mobile app serves as an intuitive command center, allowing users to view live methane readings. A video feed gives operators a clear view of the entire right-of-way, providing a real-time visual reference, and enhancing situational awareness during operations. Simultaneously, live PPM readings deliver immediate feedback on methane levels, ensuring proactive monitoring and response capabilities. The app's GPS map facilitates accurate tracking and recording of the detection area, optimizing data collection efficiency.

### REAL-TIME INFORMATION

With the Vanguard information architecture, post-flight analysis is simple. Using the iPad, the pilot can share the methane readings via a KML file which opens in Google Earth. The methane parts per million are graphically displayed as a height map when opened with Google Earth, allowing users to pinpoint definite locations of suspected leaks.
