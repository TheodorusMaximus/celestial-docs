# Insider Intelligence Questions - VanGuard Preferences

## Billing Model Intelligence

**Casual Questions for Your Friend:**

### 1. Budget & Payment Preferences
*"When VanGuard typically brings in consultants for tech projects, do they prefer knowing exactly what they'll spend upfront, or are they more comfortable with time-and-materials where they pay as you go?"*

*"Is their finance team more comfortable with fixed budgets they can approve once, or do they like the flexibility to adjust scope as projects develop?"*

### 2. Risk Tolerance & Control
*"How hands-on does the leadership team like to be with technical projects? Do they prefer to stay involved in the details, or do they like consultants to just deliver results?"*

*"When they've done R&D projects before, have they preferred to be part of the development process, or do they like turnkey solutions where they see the final result?"*

### 3. Decision-Making Style
*"Who typically makes the call on consultant billing structures - is that [specific name] or does it go through finance/procurement?"*

*"Do they have any strong preferences about how consulting agreements are structured? Any past experiences that went really well or poorly?"*

### 4. Internal Capabilities Assessment
*"How much technical bandwidth does the team have internally right now? Are they looking for consultants to augment their team, or do they need someone to own a project completely?"*

*"Do they have developers or technical people who would want to be involved in a computer vision project, or would they prefer to outsource the whole thing?"*

### 5. Timeline & Pressure Context
*"Is there any urgency on this threat detection thing? Like, are customers asking for it, or competitors doing something that's putting pressure on them?"*

*"What's their comfort level with projects that might take 9-12 months vs needing something faster?"*

## Strategic Context Questions

### 6. Competitive Landscape
*"Have they looked at other solutions for automated threat detection? Any vendors they've talked to or ruled out?"*

*"Are customers specifically asking for this capability, or is it more of a 'nice to have' enhancement?"*

### 7. Internal Politics & Stakeholders
*"Who's the main champion for this project internally? Is there anyone who might be resistant to bringing in outside help?"*

*"How does the technical team generally feel about working with consultants vs building things in-house?"*

### 8. Success Criteria & Expectations
*"What would make this project a clear win for them? Is it more about the technology working, or proving ROI, or something else?"*

*"Do they have any specific performance expectations, or are they pretty open to seeing what's possible?"*

## Conversation Starters

**Natural Opening:**
*"Hey, thanks again for the intro to VanGuard. As I'm putting together my proposal, I want to make sure I structure it in a way that fits how they like to work. Can I pick your brain about their preferences?"*

**Closing:**
*"This is really helpful context. I want to make sure my proposal feels like a natural fit for how they operate rather than trying to force them into a structure that doesn't work for them."*
