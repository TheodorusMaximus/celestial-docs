- Comprehensive dataset analysis (DOTA, AIDCON, xView)
- SOTA model benchmarks and performance baselines

### ✅ **Well-Defined MVP & Requirements**
**Documents:** `PRD-Sign-of-Life-MVP.md`, `User-Personas-and-Stories.md`
- 14 detailed requirements (SOL-01 through SOL-14) 
- Research-grounded proxy validation strategy
- Clear success metrics and validation approach

### ✅ **Competitive Analysis**
**Documents:** `Competitive-Landscape.md`, Market research data
- Overwatch Imaging benchmark analysis
- Market sizing and growth projections
- Differentiation strategy for pipeline focus

### ✅ **Technical Architecture Foundation**
**Documents:** `Current-State-Hardware.md`, `Current-State-Software.md`
- Deep understanding of VanGuard's existing systems
- Integration pathway with Falcon pod and iPad interface
- Edge computing validation approach

## Critical Gaps (What We Need)

### ❌ **1. TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIFICATION** - CRITICAL GAP
**Need:** Detailed engineering blueprint for MVP implementation including:
- Complete system architecture diagrams and data flow
- Software component specifications and interfaces
- Hardware requirements and integration points
- Implementation details for all 14 SOL requirements
- Testing protocols and validation procedures
- Deployment and integration methodology

**Impact:** Cannot demonstrate technical competency or provide implementation roadmap without detailed engineering specification

### ❌ **2. DETAILED PROJECT PLAN** - CRITICAL GAP
**Need:** Comprehensive work breakdown structure with:
- Named tasks with clear prerequisites and dependencies
- Effort estimates and resource requirements
- Critical path analysis and timeline modeling
- Milestone definitions and deliverable schedules
- Risk-based contingency planning

**Impact:** Cannot provide credible timeline or cost estimates without this

### ❌ **3. DATA STRATEGY DEEP DIVE** - CRITICAL GAP  
**Need:** Comprehensive data acquisition and training strategy covering:
- Build vs Buy vs License analysis for each dataset option
- Open source dataset evaluation and licensing terms
- Custom data collection strategy and cost modeling
- Domain transfer validation methodology
- Generalization testing framework for VanGuard's specific hardware stack

**Impact:** Biggest project risk remains unaddressed without detailed data strategy

### ✅ **4. HYPOTHESIS & RISK TRACKING FRAMEWORK** - COMPLETED
**Delivered:** Systematic validation framework including:
- 20+ explicit hypothesis statements with measurable success criteria
- Comprehensive risk register with mitigation strategies
- Validation timeline and decision points
- Pivot triggers and alternative pathways
- Evidence tracking and decision audit trail

### ❌ **5. COST & TIMELINE ANALYSIS** - CRITICAL GAP
