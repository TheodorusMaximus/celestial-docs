# Hypothesis & Risk Tracking Framework

**Summary:** This document provides a systematic framework for tracking, validating, and mitigating all critical assumptions underlying the PipelineVision project. Every project decision is grounded in explicit hypothesis testing with measurable success criteria and defined pivot strategies.

## Framework Overview

### Validation Philosophy
Our approach follows **evidence-based project management** where every assumption is:
1. **Explicitly Stated** - No implicit assumptions or unstated dependencies
2. **Measurably Testable** - Clear success/failure criteria with objective metrics
3. **Time-Bounded** - Specific validation timeline and decision points
4. **Pivot-Enabled** - Alternative pathways defined for each failure scenario

### Risk Classification System
- **Level 1 (Project-Critical)**: Failure would fundamentally invalidate project viability
- **Level 2 (Approach-Critical)**: Failure would require major methodology changes
- **Level 3 (Implementation-Critical)**: Failure would require tactical adjustments
- **Level 4 (Optimization)**: Failure would reduce efficiency but not block progress

## Hypothesis Evolution & Learning Framework

### **Learning Integration Process**
1. **Evidence Collection**: Systematic data gathering from each validation test
2. **Hypothesis Refinement**: Update predictions based on new evidence
3. **Strategy Adaptation**: Modify approach based on validated learnings
4. **Documentation**: Maintain audit trail of all decisions and pivots

### **Decision Audit Trail**
Every major project decision will be documented with:
- **Hypothesis Being Tested**: Which assumption prompted the decision
- **Evidence Considered**: Data, research, or validation results informing choice
- **Alternative Options**: Other pathways considered and why they were rejected
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll know if the decision was correct
- **Rollback Strategy**: How to reverse the decision if evidence changes

This framework ensures that every project decision is traceable, evidence-based, and reversible based on new learning.
