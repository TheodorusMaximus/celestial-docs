# MOC: Pipeline Threat Detection Project

**Summary:** This note serves as a Map of Content (MOC) for the project to develop and deploy a computer vision (CV) system for VanGuard Pipeline to detect threats along pipeline corridors from their aircraft.

**Body:**
Consulting project initiated by Austin to assist VanGuard Pipeline in integrating computer vision capabilities onto their existing gas detection aircraft. The goal is to create an MVP system that can identify, flag, and report potential threats (e.g., heavy equipment, vehicles, people) near pipeline rights-of-way in real-time.

**Project Start Date:** 2024-08-14 (First Meeting)
